# Dinosaur Book (Operating System Concepts 10e)

I am trying to learn about operating systems and system programming from the dinosaur book (Operating System Concepts 10e, see: https://os-book.com/). I will use this repository to keep track of my progress and the programming exercises which I will do. I will probably also do some programming projects from the OSTEP book if I have time. If you run some code from this repo, better use a linux distro which runs in a virtual machine for safety reasons.
